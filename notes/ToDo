== Language Model
- Move TestML::Runtime::TAP to TestML::Adapter::TAP
- Make assertions into regular function calls.

== Compiler
- Add and honor #line numbers in preprocessor.
- Add line numbers to the AST
- Add line numbers and context to error messages.

== Functions
- Allow functions to return values.

== Refactoring
- Rename transform to 'call'
  - expression: <object> <call>*

== Debugging
- XXX, et al are not reporting the correct line they came from.

== Standard
- Add a standard transform for data parse

- Allow quotes for line points
- Support Native objects

== Tests
- Data types
- List assertions
- Standard string transforms
- Standard list transforms
- Functions

== Application Tests
- from glossary
- from test::base
- from testml-pm6 tests
- convert yaml::xs
